# Abstract : 
The arrival of Big Data allowed the collection
of high volumes of a variety of data in which
valuable information and knowledge can be
found. In the current era of Artificial
Intelligence, data mining, as well as machine
learning techniques, are developed to support
advanced knowledge discovery from this huge
quantity of data. 

An important source of big data can be game
data. In the case of chess, it is one of the most
played games in the world, gathering millions
of people, and creating numerous interactions,
therefore one of the most studied games.
Thus, a huge amount of data is produced and
represented in various formats, making their
exploration and analysis faster, easier, and
more efficient.

In 2021, Rafal Drezewski and Grzegorz Wator
published a paper describing how they
developed a model that determines the
outcome of a game, through two statics data
representations (algebraic and bitmap): they
obtained an accuracy of 69%.

In this paper, we present an alternative model
to determine the outcome of a game with a
dynamic representation. We had to experiment
on the Bitmap and Algebraic representations
first, to have reference values specific to our
dataset and comparable to the results of the
dynamic representation.

We obtained an accuracy for the bitmap of
53% for the Content Model and 58% for the
Context Match Fusion. The algebraic
representation gave us accuracies of 51% and
55% for the respective models. Eventually, our
dynamic representation showed better results
than algebraic results but remains inferior to
the bitmap representation: 52% and 56% for
the respective models.
